            <p>Hello, my name is Felipe Delatorre. I am a COCC and OSU-Cascades graduate from Bend, Oregon. Bend is a city in the center of Oregon next to other much smaller cities. The area is often referred to as Central Oregon. Central Oregon is a very outdoor-sy place. However, I very much like to spend my time chilling and relaxing rather than being in the outdoors. Do not get my wrong, I love the outdoors but in small doses. For its location Bend has a great variety of restaurants. My favorite restaurants in Bend are La Rosa, Pho Viet, and Noi. Yes, I very much like ethnic food. When the time arrives one of my primary motivators to explore the world will be to try different foods. I have been told many times that Asian cousin is one of the best.</p>
